## Exercise

**Your second article! Jump right to the requirements for an updated list of what we covered.**

When looking for a job, having a good web presense is important. There are many ways to improve your web presense: LinkedIn, GitHub, etc. Today, we are going to try Medium.

[Medium](https://medium.com) is an online platform where someone can read and write opinions easily. Some people use it like a newspaper, reading top stories or opinions in some topic. Many people, [including myself](https://medium.com/@16bits), use this as a way to show that they have a well-thought opinion about *something*.

This is very important in the tech field. When searching for potential candidates, interviewers tend to give an edge to those who code and also contributes their knowledge to the community.

So, get started by creating an account on [Medium.com](https://medium.com). Make sure to follow the companies that you are interested in, such as [General Assembly (@ga)](https://medium.com/@ga)!

#### Requirements

Once you've created an account, the homework is as follows:

Write an article, giving your opinion on something you have learned in this course. This can be something you like doing, something you find interesting, a guide on how to do or use something in particular, or even just an article describing the journey of learning Android and Java. It's up to you. Show the world that you know what you are talking about!

The only requirement is that the article is at least 150 words long (not counting snippits of code).

**Also, you cannot write about the same topic you wrote about in Medium Article 1!**

Some of the topics we've covered so far:

* Material Design
* Enabling accessibility to your apps
* Designing for multiple devices
* Dialogs
* SQLite and Databases
* SQLiteOpenHelper
* SearchView
* Unit Testing
* Android Activity Lifecycle
* Event Handlers and the different types of them
* Classes and Subclasses
* Custom Adapters
* The Importance of Paper Prototyping
* The different types of views in Android
* Things you must know to make Android apps
